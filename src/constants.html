				As the name would suggest constants are designed to contain un-changing data that can be referenced from other 
				parts of the codebase to ensure that there is a tight-coupling of the data and consistency throughout the code.

				The generated code for the <code>UserType</code> is an example of a generated constant model.  Constant models 
				can not be modified in any way and as such the following interactions can not be generated:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Updaters</li>
				<li>Deleters</li>
				<li>Inserters</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				You may however genereate the following interactions:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Questions</li>
				<li>Counters</li>
				<li>Finders</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The reasoning behind constant models is to allow fast lookup on data that doesn't change, so the utility of the 
				interactions is questionable.
			</p>

			<h4>Additional methods and member variables</h4>

			<p>
				In addition to the general generation mentioned above, for each of the constant models, the following field and 
				method signatures are generated:
			</p>

			<p><strong>Static Final Member Variable References</strong></p>

			<pre>
				<code>
public static final UserType NORMAL = new UserType(new Long(1), "normal");{\n}
public static final UserType SPECIAL = new UserType(new Long(2), "special");{\n}
public static final UserType ADMIN = new UserType(new Long(3), "admin");{\n}
public static final UserType SUPER_ADMIN = new UserType(new Long(4), "super admin");{\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				For each of the constant definitions a <code>public static final</code> member variable is generated which can 
				then be referenced from other parts of the code.  Should any of the constants be renamed, deleted or removed, 
				compiler errors are generated.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Static lookup member variables</strong></p>

			<pre>
				<code>
public static UserType[] ALL = {{{\n}
{\t}UserType.NORMAL, UserType.SPECIAL, UserType.ADMIN, UserType.SUPER_ADMIN{\n}
};{\n}
{\n}
public static HashMap&gt;Long, UserType&lt; ALL_LOOKUP = new HashMap&gt;Long, UserType&lt;();{\n}
static{{{\n}
{\t}ALL_LOOKUP.put(new Long(1), UserType.NORMAL);{\n}
{\t}ALL_LOOKUP.put(new Long(2), UserType.SPECIAL);{\n}
{\t}ALL_LOOKUP.put(new Long(3), UserType.ADMIN);{\n}
{\t}ALL_LOOKUP.put(new Long(4), UserType.SUPER_ADMIN);{\n}
};{\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				The static lookup member variables allow quick lookups from other parts of the code and ensure with 
				tight-binding that should they change at any point in time that any referenced code will fail with compile time 
				errors
