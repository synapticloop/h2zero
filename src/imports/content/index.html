<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	h2zero is an easy to use object relationship mapper (ORM) code generator for Java and MySQL.
</p>

<h4>No..</h4>

<ol>
	<li><strong>boring</strong> hand generation of POJOs to map to the database</li>
	<li><strong>ugly and inefficient</strong> SQL queries</li>
	<li><strong>exceptions</strong> <em>(unless you want them)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>
	The code that is generated does not change with each generation (unless of course you change the 
	h2zero file).  <em>In fact - you could just use one of the plugins and generate it at build time</em>
</p>

<h4>Yes..</h4>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Automatically generated</strong> POJOs</li>
	<li><strong>Finders</strong> for finding subsets of the table</li>
	<li><strong>Updaters</strong> for updating subsets of the table</li>
	<li><strong>Deleters</strong> for deleting subsets of the table</li>
	<li><strong>Inserters</strong> for inserting subsets of the table</li>
	<li><strong>Counters</strong> When you just want a simple count of the subset (or all) of the table</li>
	<li><strong>Questions</strong> When you just want a simple boolean response to a question</li>
	<li><strong>Validation</strong> to ensure that the <strong>majority of errors are caught</strong> before runtime</li>
</ol>

<h3>The little things</h3>

<p>
	Beautiful code generation... Because:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>spacing is important, </li>
	<li>new-lines are important, </li>
	<li>comments, </li>
	<li>tabs,</li>
	<li>ordering is important</li>
</ul>

<p>
	it is probably the smallest of things. However the generated code, not only has to work, we believe 
	that it also has to look the part as well.  As they say <em>"The cloth maketh the man"</em>.
</p>

<h4>If nothing changes... nothing changes</h4>

<p>
	No more file changes for generation.  If the h2zero file generation is the same, you won't see any file 
	differences (unless you update to a newer version of h2zero that is) - we don't put dates, change-able 
	comments or anything else in it
</p>

<h4>How do I change it?</h4>

<p>
	We tell you what file was used to generate the code - we use the templar templating language, which is open 
	source and easily modifiable.
</p>

<p>
Easy editing of the templar files.  If you don't like the way that we generate the file, you are free to 
modify it any way that suits you.  Let's be honest though, you are not looking for something which you can get 
into the code, and modify and all that malarky - so raise an issue on github and we will look into it for you.
</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>
		Exceptions, darn those Exceptions.  Whilst we based h2zero generation on the EJB model (and yes, people still 
		use these things) - we felt that sometimes you just don't need to throw an exception if you already have an 
		expectation of what you want.  The classic example is the login page.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>User logs in with email address and password</li>
	<li>You try to find the user by email address and password</li>
	<li>Couldn't find it - EXCEPTION, EXCEPTION, EXCEPTION</li>
	<li>you can just choose to return null (by using the *Silent method signature) - in the above case this means that you couldn't find the user and happily display an error message, rather than littering your code with try/catch/finally code everywhere.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h3>

<p>
	For those that are looking to dive straight into the code, there are two simple key concepts that need to be 
	understood within the h2zero framework.  Throughout the documentation there is references made to:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>the model</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		This is the plain old java object (POJO) which maps to a single row in a database table.  They come in two 
		versions, namely regular (the main usage) and constant (for very narrow usage).
	</dd>
	<dt><strong>interactions</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		Interactions refer to any of the generated code that interacts with the database tables, this includes: finders, 
		updaters, deleters, inserters, counters and questions.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
	There are so many object relational mappers (ORMs) out there that do what h2zero does. 
	It isn't special, it just provides a link between your database and generates your Java 
	code to be able to use it.
</p>

<p>Unlike other ORMs, you have full control of the SQL that is generated. So, if you<p>

<ul>
	<li>use MySQL</li>
	<li>use Java</li>
	<li>optionally use tomcat (JSPs/Tag Libraries/Servlets)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then this may be the ORM for you.<p>

<p>
	Unlike other ORMs, most (not all, but most) of the SQL must be hand-crafted by 
	you, no horrible best-effort code generation, no horrific un-parseable SQL 
	statements in the logs. Just pure SQL that was hand-crafted by you to get the 
	best performance out of the database.
</p>

<p>
	You have complete control over the SQL statements that are executed meaning 
	that you can optimise your statements the way you want them, not the way that 
	the generator thinks you should.
</p>

<p><strong>Your</strong> database, just the way that <strong>you</strong> designed it.</p>
