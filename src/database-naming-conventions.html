			</h3>

			<p>
				Whilst everybody has their own database naming conventions, we recommend 
				using snake_case 'reverse yoda' naming - this name came from an old joke 
				a long time ago.  Nevertheless - we do recommend the snake_case as it makes
				it more readable - especially for people of foreign languages.
			</p>

			<p>
				The naming of the {import src/imports/links/fields.templar} echoes throughout 
				the generated code and is a recommended way of keeping things consitent.  That 
				being said, there are no reasons that camelCase naming conventions will not work, 
				howvere this is untested.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also recommend that each field is prefixed with it's type, as listed 
				below.  This may not be a complete list, however it has stood us in good 
				stead.
			</p>

			<h3>Important!</h3>

			<p>
				Each table that is generated <strong>MUST</strong> contain a primary key
				of type bigint.
			</p>

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>prefix</th>
						<th>meaning</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>id_</code></strong></td>
						<td>
							Primary key usage and unique identifiers.  In the case of a primary 
							key for a table, the recommended field name is <code>id_&lt;table_name&gt;</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>txt_</code></strong></td>
						<td>For textual representations</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>nm_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Proper names for fields, e.g. <code>nm_person</code>, <code>nm_country</code></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>num_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Numbers (integers/bigints)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>fl_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Flags - i.e. boolean types - should always be of type tinyint(1)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>cd_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Codes for the data - i.e. <code>cd_postcode</code></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>flt_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Floating point values.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code>dbl_</code></strong></td>
						<td>Double precision values</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong><code></code></strong></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<p>
				And whilst not actually required, this will help with the code generation 
				and keep it consistent throughout the code.
